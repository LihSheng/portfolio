# Sample Portfolio Project

This is a sample project that demonstrates modern web development practices using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Overview

The project showcases:
- Server-side rendering with Next.js
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Modern deployment with Vercel

## Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Example code snippet
export function SampleComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Sample Component</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
        This is a sample component demonstrating the project structure.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

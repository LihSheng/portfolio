# Issue Tracker

A modern issue tracking application built with Next.js and TypeScript, designed to help teams manage bugs, feature requests, and project tasks efficiently. Features a clean interface and robust functionality for project management workflows.

## Project Overview

The Issue Tracker is a Next.js-based application that provides teams with essential tools for tracking and managing project issues. Built with modern web technologies, it offers a streamlined approach to bug tracking and project management with an emphasis on usability and performance.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Issue Management**: Create, update, and track issues throughout their lifecycle
- **Project Organization**: Organize issues by projects and categories
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor issue progress with customizable status workflows
- **Priority Management**: Assign and filter issues by priority levels
- **User Assignment**: Assign issues to team members for accountability

### Technical Features
- **Modern Stack**: Built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript for reliability
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices
- **Fast Performance**: Server-side rendering for quick page loads
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation for robust development

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
The application follows Next.js App Router conventions with a component-based architecture:

```typescript
// Issue management with TypeScript interfaces
interface Issue {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  status: 'open' | 'in-progress' | 'closed';
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  assignee?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

// Issue service for data management
class IssueService {
  async createIssue(issueData: Omit<Issue, 'id' | 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt'>) {
    const issue: Issue = {
      ...issueData,
      id: generateId(),
      createdAt: new Date(),
      updatedAt: new Date()
    };
    
    return await this.saveIssue(issue);
  }
  
  async updateIssueStatus(id: string, status: Issue['status']) {
    const issue = await this.getIssue(id);
    if (!issue) throw new Error('Issue not found');
    
    issue.status = status;
    issue.updatedAt = new Date();
    
    return await this.saveIssue(issue);
  }
}
```

### Component Structure
```jsx
// Main issue list component
function IssueList({ issues, onIssueUpdate }) {
  const [filter, setFilter] = useState('all');
  const [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState('createdAt');
  
  const filteredIssues = useMemo(() => {
    return issues
      .filter(issue => filter === 'all' || issue.status === filter)
      .sort((a, b) => new Date(b[sortBy]) - new Date(a[sortBy]));
  }, [issues, filter, sortBy]);
  
  return (
    <div className="issue-list">
      <IssueFilters 
        currentFilter={filter} 
        onFilterChange={setFilter}
        sortBy={sortBy}
        onSortChange={setSortBy}
      />
      
      <div className="issues-grid">
        {filteredIssues.map(issue => (
          <IssueCard 
            key={issue.id} 
            issue={issue} 
            onUpdate={onIssueUpdate}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

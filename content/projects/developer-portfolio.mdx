- **Dark/Light Theme**: System-aware theme switching with smooth transitions and persistence
- **Contact Integration**: Validated contact form with email service integration
- **SEO Optimized**: Comprehensive meta tags, OpenGraph, Twitter cards, and structured data
- **Performance Focused**: Static generation, image optimization, and code splitting

### Technical Highlights
- **Modern Stack**: Next.js 16 with App Router, TypeScript 5.9+, and Tailwind CSS 4
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component with WebP/AVIF support and blur placeholders
- **Animation System**: Framer Motion integration with performance optimizations
- **Content Management**: MDX support for dynamic content with syntax highlighting
- **Development Tools**: ESLint, Prettier, git workflow automation, and Playwright testing

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions

**Next.js App Router**: Leveraged the latest App Router for improved performance and developer experience with server components by default and client components only when needed for interactivity.

**TypeScript Strict Mode**: Implemented comprehensive type safety with strict TypeScript configuration, ensuring code reliability and better developer experience.

**Component Architecture**: Built reusable, composable components following React best practices with proper separation of concerns and clean interfaces.

### Performance Optimizations

```typescript
// Image optimization with blur placeholders
<Image
  src={project.image}
  alt={project.title}
  fill
  className="object-cover"
  placeholder="blur"
  blurDataURL={shimmerPlaceholderDataUrl}
  sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 40vw"
/>
```

**Static Generation**: Utilized Next.js static generation for optimal loading performance and SEO benefits.

**Code Splitting**: Implemented dynamic imports and component-level code splitting to reduce initial bundle size.

**Font Optimization**: Integrated Inter font with proper loading strategies and fallbacks.

### State Management & Data Flow

**Server Components**: Maximized use of server components for data fetching and rendering, reducing client-side JavaScript.

**Theme Management**: Implemented robust theme system using next-themes with proper hydration handling and system preference detection.

**Form Handling**: Built validated contact form with proper error handling and email integration using API routes.

## 🎨 Design & User Experience

### Visual Design
- **Typography**: Inter font family for modern, readable typography
- **Color System**: Carefully crafted color palette supporting both light and dark themes
- **Spacing & Layout**: Consistent spacing system using Tailwind CSS utilities
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Mobile-first design with optimized layouts for all screen sizes

### Animations & Interactions
- **Smooth Transitions**: Framer Motion animations with reduced motion support
- **Loading States**: Shimmer placeholders and progressive loading for better perceived performance
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle interactive elements enhancing user engagement
- **Navigation**: Smooth mobile menu with proper accessibility considerations

### Accessibility
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper HTML structure with semantic elements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility support

- **Color Contrast**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant color combinations

## 🚀 Development Workflow

### Git Workflow Automation
Custom scripts for consistent development workflow:

```bash
npm run git:feature     # Create new feature branch
npm run git:dev         # Switch to development branch
npm run git:merge-dev   # Merge to development
npm run git:merge-main  # Merge to production
```

### Code Quality
- **ESLint**: Next.js recommended rules with custom additions
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting with Tailwind plugin

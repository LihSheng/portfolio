# My Weather

A modern, responsive weather application that provides real-time weather information with a clean and intuitive user interface. Built with Next.js 14 and TypeScript for optimal performance and developer experience.

## Project Overview

My Weather is a Next.js-based weather application that delivers accurate weather data through a beautiful, responsive interface. The project demonstrates modern React development practices with TypeScript integration and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Weather Data**: Current weather conditions for any location
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean interface built with Tailwind CSS
- **TypeScript Integration**: Full type safety throughout the application
- **Performance Optimized**: Built with Next.js 14 for fast loading times
- **API Integration**: Seamless integration with weather data providers

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
The application follows Next.js 14 App Router conventions with a component-based architecture:

```typescript
// Weather data fetching with proper error handling
async function getWeatherData(location: string) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/weather?location=${location}`);
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Weather data unavailable');
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch weather data:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

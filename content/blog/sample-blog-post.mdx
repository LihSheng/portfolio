# Getting Started with Next.js App Router

The Next.js App Router represents a significant evolution in how we build React applications. In this post, we'll explore the key concepts and benefits of this new architecture.

## What is the App Router?

The App Router is a new paradigm introduced in Next.js 13 that provides:

- **Server Components by default**: Better performance and SEO
- **Nested layouts**: More flexible page structures
- **Loading and error states**: Built-in UI patterns
- **Streaming**: Progressive page rendering

## Key Features

### 1. File-based Routing

```typescript
// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
export default function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  return <div>Blog post: {params.slug}</div>;
}
```

### 2. Layout Components

```typescript
// app/layout.tsx
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### 3. Server Components

Server Components run on the server and can directly access databases and APIs without exposing sensitive information to the client.

## Migration Tips

When migrating from the Pages Router:

1. Start with the root layout
2. Move pages to the app directory
3. Update imports and exports
4. Test thoroughly

## Conclusion

The App Router provides a more intuitive and powerful way to build Next.js applications. While there's a learning curve, the benefits in terms of performance and developer experience are significant.

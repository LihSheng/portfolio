# Web Accessibility: A Developer's Guide

Building accessible web applications is not just good practice—it's essential for creating inclusive digital experiences.

## Why Accessibility Matters

- **Legal compliance**: Many countries have accessibility laws
- **Better UX**: Accessible design benefits all users
- **SEO benefits**: Screen readers and search engines have similar needs
- **Larger audience**: Don't exclude users with disabilities

## Key Principles (WCAG)

### 1. Perceivable
- Provide text alternatives for images
- Use sufficient color contrast
- Make content adaptable to different presentations

### 2. Operable
- Make all functionality keyboard accessible
- Give users enough time to read content
- Don't use content that causes seizures

### 3. Understandable
- Make text readable and understandable
- Make content appear and operate predictably
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### 4. Robust
- Maximize compatibility with assistive technologies

## Practical Implementation

### Semantic HTML

```html
<nav aria-label="Main navigation">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/home">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

### ARIA Labels

```html
<button aria-label="Close dialog" onclick="closeDialog()">
  ×
</button>
```

### Focus Management

```css
.button:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #007acc;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

## Testing Your Accessibility

1. **Keyboard navigation**: Tab through your entire site
2. **Screen reader testing**: Use NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver
3. **Automated tools**: axe-core, Lighthouse accessibility audit
4. **Color contrast**: Use tools like WebAIM's contrast checker

## Conclusion

Accessibility should be considered from the start of any project, not as an afterthought. By following these guidelines, you'll create better experiences for all users.
